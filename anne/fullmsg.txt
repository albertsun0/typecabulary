Hi Selina,

I cant believe it, already a year together. Time goes so fast when I am with u. This year has been only amazing, all because of you. I am so happy waking up knowing I have you every day, the cutest, most beautiful, girl in the world. I am so excited to hear your voice or snuggle every day, and you are the brightest thing in my life.


Remember the CS competiton we did together and with Arvin last year? That was really fun, and you were so cute solving problems. I was so happy that you did some problems by yourself (frik Arvin), and you learned everything so fast! This may seem like the other challenges, but it might be easier with some code. The answer is every 3rd and every 19th character in this string. 

ans: I'm so proud of you. Lets make more games together, except you should help with the code. :smirkcat:
