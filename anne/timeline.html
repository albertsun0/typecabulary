	<center><h1>Happy Anniversary!!</h1></center>
	<p>I cant believe it, already a year together. Time goes so fast when I am with u. This year has been only amazing, all because of you. I am so happy waking up knowing I have you every day, the cutest, most beautiful, girl in the world. I am so excited to hear your voice or snuggle every day, and you are the brightest thing in my life.</p>

	<p>If you asked me what my favorite memory of us is, I would have to give you a whole list, because every day with you is better than the last, and every day is full of new laughs and fun. I am so excited to spend more time with you, and for our entire life together, so many new memories to make.</p>
	<p>I love you so much baby. </p>
	<p>-Your Albee</p>
	<br>
	<p>P.S. I would e-date you forever.</p>
